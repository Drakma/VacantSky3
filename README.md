## About <a name = "about"></a>

Vacant Sky 3 is a complete re-imaging of Vacant Sky 1/2 in Minecraft 1.16.5.  This pack is supposed to be moderately difficult but not so difficult that you'll rage quit.

As you start standing on the top of a tree, navigate your way through the different mods in sandbox style gameplay.  alternatively, the Quest Book will guide you through each mod and give you and "End Game."

Discover new dimensions and biomes.  From the cold and lifeless Deep Dark to the dark and creepy Hell biomes you will discover new places to travel and build.

The adventure is up to you!

## Dimensions & Biomes <a name = "dims"></a>

Hell- This biome is like The Nether, but has a skybox.

Sunny - A new Desert setting that is void of life.

Temperate - Creatures flourish in these 3 new biomes because there are no hostile mobs to kill them

Deep Dark - These biomes have no sun and are extremely cold.  Only the toughest of creatures survive in these icy biomes.

Panda Park - Panda! Panda's Everywhere.  You don't know why, but you need this new dimension.

All of the above dimensions/biomes are made specifically to generate creatures only and no mobs.  There is no ore generations either.
